# ML.Classification

**The extra points project for the midterm exam as follows**

1. Process the dataset (select 1 of the 4) provided
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) by
applying and comparing accuracies of kNN, DT, Na√Øve-base,
LRM, Logit.
2. Check dataset and do preprocessing (missing value
interpretation, transformations etc)
3. Show the scatter plot and display correlations for those features
whose correlation is higher than 0.6. Do everything in one
scatter plot.
4. Try different variations and parameters for above algorithms and
check metrics. For example kNN with k=3,5,9, various DTs, NBs
and RMs etc
5. Display accuracies for each different variation. For example:
applied transformation check the metrics etc.,
6. You can implement program in menu based form
7. Prepare explanatory document and present in the class
8. For the grade document and program must be submitted to
instructor for check. This project is individual
